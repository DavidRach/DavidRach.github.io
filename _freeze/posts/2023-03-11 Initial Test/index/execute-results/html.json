Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time before Cyto2023 to polish up this blogpost with all my thoughts about Autofluorescence (AF). But please reach out (or drop by my poster #195) and ask, because I have been thinking about the topic a lot these past couple months, and have some interesting preliminary data from my R script about how AF impacts my Spectral Flow Panels. Best- David\n\n![](FlowJoWorkflow.jpg) ![](AutofluorescentTags.jpg)\n\n![](AutofluorescentWorkflow.png)\n\n![](Lineplots.png)\n\n![](Cosine.png)\n",
