Before moving to Baltimore for graduate school, I served in the US Peace Corps as a Secondary Science Education Volunteer, in Ghana (West Africa) from 2016-2018, teaching biology and chemistry at a rural high school in the Volta region in the SE corner of the country.

I received my A.S in Natural Resources Biology from [Northwest College](https://nwc.edu/), where thanks to the opportunities for undergraduate research supported by Wyoming [INBRE](http://www.uwyo.edu/wyominginbre/) I first became interested in Microbiology. I then transferred to the [University of Wyoming](http://www.uwyo.edu/) where I completed my B.S. in Molecular Biology and Microbiology in 2016. It was here I became interested in Immunology, as I researched NK cell responses in mice to *Toxoplasma gondii* infection in the lab of [Jason Gigley](http://www.uwyo.edu/molecbio/faculty-and-staff/jason-gigley/index.html)

"Where are you from?" is a question I am frequently asked, but defies a simple answer. When I was two, my family moved to Chiapas, Mexico to work. And that's where we remained.
