I am a graduate of [Northwest College](https://nwc.edu/), receiving my A.S in Natural Resources Biology. It was here thanks to undergraduate research opportunities through [INBRE](http://www.uwyo.edu/wyominginbre/) that I first became interested in Microbiology. After Northwest, I transferred to the [University of Wyoming](http://www.uwyo.edu/) where I received a B.S. in Molecular Biology and Microbiology, where I became interested in Immunology while researching NK cell responses to secondary *Toxoplasma gondii* infection in the lab of [Jason Gigley](http://www.uwyo.edu/molecbio/faculty-and-staff/jason-gigley/index.html).

Before moving to Baltimore for graduate school, I served in the [Peace Corps](https://www.peacecorps.gov/) as a Secondary Science Teacher in [Ghana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana) from 2016-2018. I taught biology and chemistry at a rural high school in the Volta Region.

"Where are you from?" is a question I am frequently asked, but defies a simple answer. When I was two, my family moved to Chiapas, Mexico to work. And that's where we remained.
