Growing up as a [Third Culture Kid](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/t-magazine/luca-guadagnino-third-culture-kids.html?unlocked_article_code=gmcO6aItnbYg-KmwHkfF8V49bsFJUEw_TG4zMswnK6wfzIPWwdVQCigYDCQotX6SwgskywRMfIjReydmC_AgY5CXrYdDTdu-zpL9pjXpmyCFXNRqSYUGQD89Q-TpWgVdKExEBfq6RL8FjfZv2pbS6OYWdJylnwMqCaltK3D1v2GB0OhmrQLaFWP79LeDntEnmcM02jGZBOKQp4QdrP2NVTYmdR1bMJxX8bKPZAgYg_NQcJTgTK6nqKJpgLmdliWD4gbtdOYDQ5hVYlGgSfG2OSdjkqaKJ9RwweS-h6zHMj8DdBHckjMG46hnz6JBGMgE-gmUh3dC9pYWhjCnKiK4QZ83jK70Zxd7KqFEvmsZgg&smid=url-share%22), "Where are you from?" is a question I always hated. The simple concise answers that the majority of my peers would provide when introductions were being made inevitably detoured down a rabbit-hole when it was my turn to introduce myself.

My family, originally from southwest Michigan, USA moved to Chiapas, Mexico for work when I was two. I learned to read and write in Spanish long before I did in English; my childhood memories include birding around the [local](https://ebird.org/hotspot/L688365?yr=all&m=&sortBy=spp) Mayan ruins on the weekends; and the only time in my life I had ever been to Cancun was after a grueling 22 hour bus ride through the mountains so that I could take my SAT exam for the US university admissions process, as it was the closest testing site.

I moved back to the US for university when I was 17. I graduated from [Northwest College](https://nwc.edu/), receiving my A.S in Natural Resources Biology. It was during my time in Powell, Wyoming that thanks to undergraduate research opportunities through [INBRE](http://www.uwyo.edu/wyominginbre/) that I first became interested in Microbiology. After Northwest, I transferred to the [University of Wyoming](http://www.uwyo.edu/) where I received a B.S. in Molecular Biology and Microbiology, and got my first taste of immunology researching Natural Killer cell responses in mice to secondary *Toxoplasma gondii* infection in the lab of Dr.[Jason Gigley](http://www.uwyo.edu/molecbio/faculty-and-staff/jason-gigley/index.html).

<br></br> After university, I served in the [Peace Corps](https://www.peacecorps.gov/) as a Secondary Science Teacher in [Ghana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana) from 2016-2018. I taught biology and chemistry at a rural high school in the Volta Region. During my time in Ghana, I worked on secondary projects focused on Malaria that led to my decision to enter a Microbiology and Immunology PhD program.

<br></br> I moved to Baltimore for my PhD in 2018. After a year and a half of classes and passing my qualifying exam, I was excited to finally start full time in the lab. Since that was March 2020, that was not going to happen. While stuck at home, I volunteered for the Pfizer Phase I clinical trial taking place at the [University of Maryland Center for Vaccine Development](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/cvd/trials/) and somehow ended up having family and friends telling me they saw my arm in the newspaper for the next nine [months](https://wjla.com/news/local/university-of-maryland-covid-trial-vaccine-recipient-success-indicators).

<br></br>  My PhD was focused on understanding the impact that exposure to maternal HIV infection and antiretrovirals before birth had on immune systems of HIV-exposed uninfected infants. The main cell types of interest were Innate-like T cells (gamma-delta T cells, MAIT, and NKTs) and more conventional T cell subsets. We started off with conventional flow cytometry, before transitioning to spectral flow cytometry during the pandemic.

<br></br>  As an early adopters of the technology at our local institution, we re-discovered through trial-and-error that we couldn't treat spectral flow cytometry like a conventional flow cytometry experiment and just throw compensation at the problem after the fact. As we learned from our early mistakes and improved, we consistently got really good unmixing and I quickly became interested in exploring unsupervised analysis.
