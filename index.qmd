I am a Molecular Microbiology and Immunology PhD Candidate at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. My thesis advisers are Drs. [Cristiana Cairo](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Cairo-Cristiana/) and [Kirsten Lyke.](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Lyke-Kirsten/)

My [thesis research](research.qmd) seeks to understand the impact that prenatal exposure to maternal viral load and antiretrovirals has on Innate-like and Adaptive T cells of HIV-exposed Uninfected Infants during early life. Working with a Malawian clinical cohort, I process cryopreserved cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for Spectral Flow Cytometry. 

When not in lab or thinking about autofluorescence, I enjoy birding, trail running, kayaking, coffee, learning new languages and have occasionally had a plant survive my summer gardening attempts.
