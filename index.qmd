I am a Molecular Microbiology and Immunology PhD Candidate at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. My thesis advisers are Drs. [Cristiana Cairo](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Cairo-Cristiana/) and [Kirsten Lyke.](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Lyke-Kirsten/)

My [thesis research](research.qmd) focuses on understanding the impact that prenatal exposure to maternal HIV and/or antiretrovirals has on the Innate-like and Adaptive T cells of HIV-exposed Uninfected (HEU) infants during early life. 

I am fascinated by the underlying heterogeneity in human immune responses to pathogens of global health relevance. I am actively learning systems immunology and statistical modeling approaches, with the goal of improving on existing supervised and unsupervised analysis techniques used for understanding cytometry data.

When not in lab, I enjoy birding, trail running, kayaking, coffee, learning new languages and occasionally have had a plant survive my summer gardening attempts.
