I am a Molecular Microbiology and Immunology PhD Candidate at the University of Maryland, School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. My thesis advisors are Drs. [Cristiana Cairo](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Cairo-Cristiana/) and [Kirsten Lyke.](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Lyke-Kirsten/)

My [thesis research](research.qmd) focuses on understanding the impact that prenatal exposure to maternal HIV and/or antiretrovirals has on Innate-like and Adaptive T cells in HIV-exposed Uninfected (HEU) infants during early life.

Using supervised and unsupervised analysis of spectral flow cytometry data, I am actively  learning systems immunology and statistical modeling approaches to better understand the heterogeneity in human immune responses to pathogens of global health relevance.  

Outside lab, I enjoy trail running, birding, kayaking, coffee, learning languages, and have been known to occasionally have plants survive my summer gardening attempts.
