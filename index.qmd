### 

I am a Molecular Microbiology and Immunology PhD Candidate at the University of Maryland, School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. My thesis advisers are Drs. [Cristiana Cairo](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Cairo-Cristiana/) and [Kirsten Lyke.](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Lyke-Kirsten/) My thesis is focused on understanding the impact that prenatal exposure to maternal HIV and/or antiretrovirals have on the innate-like and adaptive T cells in HIV-exposed Uninfected (HEU) infants, and what are the consequences of these exposures during early life.
