My thesis project is focused on understanding how prenatal exposure to HIV affects the immune systems of HIV-exposed Uninfected (HEU) infants, and what the consequences of these exposures are in early life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolta Region, Ghana\nAfter Wyoming, but before moving to Baltimore for graduate school, I served in the US Peace Corps as a Secondary Science Education Volunteer, in Ghana (West Africa) from 2016-2018, teaching biology and chemistry at a rural high school in the Volta region in the SE corner of the country.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWyoming\n\n\n\nI received my A.S in Natural Resources Biology from Northwest College, where thanks to the opportunities for undergraduate research supported by Wyoming INBRE I first became interested in Microbiology. I then transferred to the University of Wyoming where I completed my B.S. in Molecular Biology and Microbiology in 2016. It was here I became interested in Immunology, as I researched NK cell responses in mice to Toxoplasma gondii infection in the lab of Jason Gigley\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChiapas, Mexico\n“Where are you from?” is a question I am frequently asked, but defies a simple answer. When I was two, my family moved to Chiapas, Mexico to work. And that’s where we remained."

    "text": "HEU Infants\n\n\n\n\nIt is estimated that 1.5 million HIV+ women give birth peryear. Thanks to improved antiretrovirals (and critically, access to them) vertical transmission from mother to child is increasingly prevented. These infants are exposed to effects of maternal virus (and viral proteins) in utero, but remain uninfected.\nDespite not being infected, these infants have increased morbidity for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections during their first six months of life, compared to infants born to HIV- women living in the same communities.\n\n\nTo address contribution that these prenatal exposures have on the infant immune system, we are following a cohort of Malawian infants, born to\n\n\nInnate-like T cells\n\n\nSpectral Flow Cytometry"
