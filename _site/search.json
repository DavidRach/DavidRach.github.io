I then transferred to the University of Wyoming where I completed my B.S. in Molecular Biology and Microbiology in 2016. It was here I became interested in Immunology, as I researched NK cell responses in mice to Toxoplasma gondii infection in the lab of Jason Gigley\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChiapas, Mexico\n‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù is a question I am frequently asked, but defies a simple answer.

    "text": "HEU Infants\n\n\n\n\nIt is estimated that 1.5 million HIV+ women give birth per year. Thanks to improved antiretrovirals (and critically, access to them) vertical transmission from mother to child is increasingly prevented. These infants are exposed to effects of maternal virus (and viral proteins) in utero, but remain uninfected.\nDespite not being infected, these infants have increased morbidity for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections during their first six months of life, compared to infants born to HIV- women living in the same communities.\n\n\nTo help understand the contribution of maternal viremia to infant immune perturbation, we are analyzing a cohort of Malawian infants with well-characterized prenatal HIV-exposure. Specifically, we are comparing three groups of infants born to women with: A) ART-treated HIV infection and undetectable viral load since before conception and through pregnancy (HEU-lo); B) HIV infection diagnosed and treated at mid-gestation or later, with high viral load at enrollment (HEU-hi); C) no HIV infection (HU).\n\n\nInnate-like T cells\nInnate-like T cells (ILTs), including Natural Killer T cells (NKTs), Mucosal-associated Invariant T cells (MAITs), and Vùõæ9Vùõø2 (Vùõø2) T cells may be perturbed due to elevated inflammation at the fetal-maternal interface during maternal HIV infection. ILTs, which are thought to play important roles against pathogens in early life, are activated by microbial metabolites as well as by innate cytokines, mounting Th1-like and cytotoxic responses in the early phase of infection. The effect exerted by in utero HIV exposure on infant ILTs is unknown, as the markers required for their identification are not routinely included in conventional flow cytometry panels, and their low abundance in infant blood makes mass cytometry impractical for their assessment.\n\n\nSpectral Flow Cytometry"
