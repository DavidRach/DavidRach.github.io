    "text": "Hi, I am David. Who am I?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù is the introductory question that as a Third Culture Kid I grew up dreading, since I never had the simple concise answer that most people expect when you first meet.\nMy family is originally from southwest Michigan, but moved to Chiapas, Mexico to work on when I was two. I learned to read and write in Spanish long before doing so in English, birdwatched around Mayan ruins growing up, and the only time I have been to Cancun was after a 22 hour bus ride to get there to take my SAT exam needed as part of the US university admissions process (it was the closest testing site).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI moved myself back to the US for college when I was 17. I graduated from Northwest College, receiving my A.S in Natural Resources Biology. It was here thanks to undergraduate research opportunities through INBRE that I first became interested in Microbiology. After Northwest, I transferred to the University of Wyoming where I received a B.S. in Molecular Biology and Microbiology, and got my first taste of immunology researching NK cell responses to secondary Toxoplasma gondii infection in the lab of Jason Gigley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n After college, I served in the Peace Corps as a Secondary Science Teacher in Ghana from 2016-2018. I taught biology and chemistry at a rural high school in the Volta Region. It was during my time in Ghana working on secondary projects focused on Malaria that I decided to enter a Microbiology and Immunology PhD program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I moved to Baltimore for my PhD in 2018. After a year and a half of classes and passing my qualifying exam, I was excited to finally start full time in the lab. This was March 2020, and it was not to be. While stuck at home, I volunteered for the Pfizer Phase I clinical trial taking place at the University of Maryland Center for Vaccine Development and somehow ended up for the next nine months with friends and family telling me they saw my arm in their newspaper again. But this was my favorite headline."

    "text": "I am a Molecular Microbiology and Immunology PhD Candidate at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. My thesis advisers are Drs. Cristiana Cairo and Kirsten Lyke.\nMy thesis research focuses on understanding the impact prenatal exposure to maternal HIV and/or antiretrovirals have on HIV-exposed Uninfected (HEU) infant‚Äôs Innate-like and Adaptive T cells during early life. Working with a Malawian clinical cohort, we are analyzing cryopreserved cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with Spectral Flow Cytometry.\nThe heterogeneity underlying human immune responses to pathogens of global health relevance is something I find fascinating. Interpreting biological signal from experimental, technical and instrumental noise in these context is the kicker. To better understand these issues, I am currently learning statistical inference and system immunology approaches with eventual goal of improving on existing supervised and unsupervised analysis of cytometry data. Because it‚Äôs tragic to collect 3 million cells to only ultimately use the median value.\nWhen not in lab, I enjoy birding, trail running, kayaking, coffee, learning new languages and occasionally have had a plant survive my summer gardening attempts."

    "text": "HEU Infants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn estimated 1.5 million HIV+ women give birth per year. Thanks to improved antiretrovirals (and critically, affordable access to them in the most affected countries), vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child is increasingly prevented. These HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants are a growing patient population in many countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being born uninfected, during their first six months of life, HEU infants have increased morbidity for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections compared to HIV-unexposed (HU) Infants living in the same communities. It‚Äôs hypothesized that inflammation at the fetal-maternal interface driven by exposure to maternal virus (and viral proteins) may perturb the developing infant immune system, resulting in the observed increased morbidity in early life. Confoundingly, antiretrovirals (ART) can also drive inflammation at the fetal-maternal interface, and are reported to alter mitochondrial function.\n\nTo better understand the contribution of maternal viremia to infant immune perturbation, we are analyzing a clinical cohort of Malawian infants with well-characterized prenatal HIV-exposure. Specifically, we are comparing three groups of infants born to women with: A) ART-treated HIV infection and undetectable viral load since before conception and through pregnancy (HEU-lo); B) HIV infection diagnosed and treated at mid-gestation or later, with high viral load (>10,000 copies/mL) at enrollment (HEU-hi); and C) no HIV infection (HU).\nAt birth, Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells were collected, and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. After initial childhood vaccination, peripheral blood from the infants was also collected at 4 and 9 months being similarly processed and stored. Ultimately, the cells were shipped here to Baltimore for flow cytometry analysis.\n\nFor my thesis project, I am interested in how the maternal viral and antiretroviral exposure affects HEU-infant‚Äôs 1) Innate-like T cells, and 2) conventional alpha beta T cells at baseline and upon activation.\nInnate-like T cells (ILTs), including Natural Killer T cells (NKTs), Mucosal-associated Invariant T cells (MAITs), and Vùõæ9Vùõø2 (Vùõø2) T cells, are activated by both microbial metabolites as well as by innate cytokines. Once activated, they mount TH1-like cytokine and cytotoxic responses, playing important roles against pathogens in adults. The effect exerted by in utero HIV exposure on infant ILTs is unknown.\nUpon arrival in Baltimore, the cells are thawed and processed for Spectral Flow Cytometry.\n\n1\n\n\n1. Hsu, H. et al.
