    "text": "Hi, I am David. Who am I?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Where are you from?” is the introductory question that as a Third Culture Kid I grew up dreading, since I never had the simple concise answer that most people expect when you first meet.\nMy family is originally from southwest Michigan, but moved to Chiapas, Mexico to work on when I was two. I learned to read and write in Spanish long before doing so in English, birdwatched around Mayan ruins growing up, and the only time I have been to Cancun was after a 22 hour bus ride to get there to take my SAT exam needed as part of the US university admissions process (it was the closest testing site).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI moved myself back to the US for college when I was 17. I graduated from Northwest College, receiving my A.S in Natural Resources Biology. It was here thanks to undergraduate research opportunities through INBRE that I first became interested in Microbiology. After Northwest, I transferred to the University of Wyoming where I received a B.S. in Molecular Biology and Microbiology, and got my first taste of immunology researching NK cell responses to secondary Toxoplasma gondii infection in the lab of Jason Gigley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n After college, I served in the Peace Corps as a Secondary Science Teacher in Ghana from 2016-2018. I taught biology and chemistry at a rural high school in the Volta Region. It was during my time in Ghana working on secondary projects focused on Malaria that I decided to enter a Microbiology and Immunology PhD program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I moved to Baltimore for my PhD in 2018. After a year and a half of classes and passing my qualifying exam, I was excited to finally start full time in the lab. This was March 2020, and it was not to be. While stuck at home, I volunteered for the Pfizer Phase I clinical trial taking place at the University of Maryland Center for Vaccine Development and somehow ended up for the next nine months with friends and family telling me they saw my arm in their newspaper again. But this was my favorite headline."

    "text": "I am a Molecular Microbiology and Immunology PhD Candidate at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. My thesis advisers are Drs. Cristiana Cairo and Kirsten Lyke.\nMy thesis research focuses on understanding the impact prenatal exposure to maternal HIV and/or antiretrovirals have on HIV-exposed Uninfected (HEU) infant’s Innate-like and Adaptive T cells during early life. Working with a Malawian clinical cohort, we are analyzing cryopreserved cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with Spectral Flow Cytometry.\nThe heterogeneity underlying human immune responses to pathogens of global health relevance is something I find fascinating. Interpreting biological signal from experimental, technical and instrumental noise in these context is the kicker. To better understand these issues, I am currently learning statistical inference and system immunology approaches with eventual goal of improving on existing supervised and unsupervised analysis of cytometry data. Because it’s tragic to collect 3 million cells to only ultimately use the median value.\nWhen not in lab, I enjoy birding, trail running, kayaking, coffee, learning new languages and occasionally have had a plant survive my summer gardening attempts."

    "text": "Waiting at the Airport for my flight to Cyto2023, so I am using this time 1) figure out logistics of blogging with Quarto, 2) write down some thoughts on Autofluorescence (AF) that have until now mostly been to scrawled margin notes on my acquisition datasheets. It’s these questions that ultimately motivated me enough to find answers that I learned how to use R to be able to answer them both qualitatively and quantitatively, but still mostly springs from my own tinkering. Consequently, reaching out to find what others experience and thoughts are as I work on actually using the tools I built to better understand the implications that Autofluorescence has when I unmix on a Spectral Flow Cytometer.\n(I will work at incorporating in illustrating figures using acquired data once I reconnect to internet and can pull/push from GitHub).\nThis all started late 2021 when while learning how to unmix I was curious, what difference to our unmixing does gating on the brightest part of single color positive peak make compared to gating average bright cells in the positive peak? When unmixing with SpectroFlo, going back and unmixing everything exactly the same with only changing the location of the single gate is not easy, and the end result is going through the two generated .fcs files comparing the results across all parameter combinations. Cursory investigation didn’t reveal anything particularly different, so I went on to other projects.\nShortly after attending Cyto virtually last year (and seeing the talk by Dr. Gonzales on using dimensionality reduction algorithms to visualize different autofluorescences) I started work optimizing our myeloid panel.\nIt was at this time that I first noticed that for some specimens, particularly under activating conditions, I began to see separate spread around the UV when acquiring on SpectroFlo from the main spectral signature. When I took these raw files, gated for monocytes, dimensionality visualized them with algorithm of choice, gated the islands and overlaid them in FlowJo’s layout, this edge represented around 5% of monocytes that had a co-equal brightness peak between UV7 and V7, whereas the main monocyte population was primarily V7.\nAround this time, I discovered how to incorportate in autofluorescent tags. When I incorporated the specific signature in, some previous unmixing errors would be resolved and get some improved resolution for these specific cells. But, if I also accounted with an additional tag for the main monocyte autofluorescence, the spread around the negative for autofluorescent similar colors (like BUV496 and BV510) also increased, affecting resolution. So the question I had, how similar or different were these autofluorescences? Visually in FlowJo Layout, they looked very different, but as Dr. Gonzales pointed out, those values were raw values, not normalized.\nAround this time I had begun tinkering with R. Rather than just do a Pearson Correlation using GraphPad Prism, how much more effort would it be to compare the two FlowJo gated islands by Cosine in R? And could it take the same inputs, generate normalized spectra, and then overlay them in a lineplot? A few days of “How to copy/paste columns in R? later, and I had a basic R script that would do what I wanted….. as long as it was exactly 4 clusters. You put in 3 or 5, the system broke down and I got an error returned on the script.\nTurns out, the visually distinct overlaid raw values I saw in FlowJo layout often were identical when it came to T cells. For my monocytes, this wasn’t the case, but they were still very similar by Cosine Similiarity, ranging from (0.93-0.97). I determined I wanted a heatmap similar to the Similarity Matrix for single colors in SpectroFlo. A couple weeks later (and more google searches) and in addition to a line plot I could now see the similarities in a heatmap.\nTo unmix, we derive the inputs that define the single colors in the matrix through gating on individually stained cells, subtracting background autofluorescence. But what happens when there are two separate background autofluorescences present? Does the more prevalent one get picked as default? Does the input become an averaged signature? How does this subtraction impact how the spectral flow cytometer defines a single color? Does this contribute to the challenges in attempting to re-use cell single colors on experiments collected weeks later when you supposedly already accounted for autofluorescence by incorporating in a specific autofluorescence from that same day?"

    "text": "HEU Infants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn estimated 1.5 million HIV+ women give birth per year. Thanks to improved antiretrovirals (and critically, affordable access to them in the most affected countries), vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child is increasingly prevented. These HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants are a growing patient population in many countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being born uninfected, during their first six months of life, HEU infants have increased morbidity for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections compared to HIV-unexposed (HU) Infants living in the same communities. It’s hypothesized that inflammation at the fetal-maternal interface driven by exposure to maternal virus (and viral proteins) may perturb the developing infant immune system, resulting in the observed increased morbidity in early life. Confoundingly, antiretrovirals (ART) can also drive inflammation at the fetal-maternal interface, and are reported to alter mitochondrial function.\n\nTo better understand the contribution of maternal viremia to infant immune perturbation, we are analyzing a clinical cohort of Malawian infants with well-characterized prenatal HIV-exposure. Specifically, we are comparing three groups of infants born to women with: A) ART-treated HIV infection and undetectable viral load since before conception and through pregnancy (HEU-lo); B) HIV infection diagnosed and treated at mid-gestation or later, with high viral load (>10,000 copies/mL) at enrollment (HEU-hi); and C) no HIV infection (HU).\nAt birth, Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells were collected, and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. After initial childhood vaccination, peripheral blood from the infants was also collected at 4 and 9 months being similarly processed and stored. Ultimately, the cells were shipped here to Baltimore for flow cytometry analysis.\n\nUpon arrival in Baltimore, the cells are thawed and processed for Spectral Flow Cytometry. For my thesis project, I am interested in how the maternal viral and antiretroviral exposure affects HEU-infant’s 1) Innate-like T cells, and 2) conventional alpha beta T cells, both at baseline and upon activation.\nInnate-like T cells (ILTs), including Natural Killer T cells (NKTs), Mucosal-associated Invariant T cells (MAITs), and V𝛾9V𝛿2 (V𝛿2) T cells, are activated by both microbial metabolites as well as by innate cytokines. Once activated, they mount TH1-like cytokine and cytotoxic responses, playing important roles against pathogens in adults. The effect exerted by in utero HIV exposure on infant ILTs is unknown.\n\n#1\n\n\n1. Hsu, H. et al.
