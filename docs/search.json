    "text": "HEU Infants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn estimated 1.5 million HIV+ women give birth per year. Thanks to improved antiretrovirals (and critically, affordable access to them in the most affected countries), vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child is increasingly prevented. These HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants are a growing patient population in many countries.1\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being born uninfected, during their first six months of life, HEU infants have increased morbidity for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections compared to HIV-unexposed (HU) Infants living in the same communities2. It‚Äôs hypothesized that inflammation at the fetal-maternal interface driven by exposure to maternal virus (and viral proteins) may perturb the developing infant immune system, resulting in the observed increased morbidity in early life.3,4 Confoundingly, antiretrovirals (ART) can also drive inflammation at the fetal-maternal interface, and are reported to alter mitochondrial function5.\n\nTo better understand the contribution of maternal viremia to infant immune perturbation, we are analyzing a clinical cohort of Malawian infants with well-characterized prenatal HIV-exposure. Specifically, we are comparing three groups of infants born to women with: A) ART-treated HIV infection and undetectable viral load since before conception and through pregnancy (HEU-lo); B) HIV infection diagnosed and treated at mid-gestation or later, with high viral load (&gt;10,000 copies/mL) at enrollment (HEU-hi); and C) no HIV infection (HU).\nAt birth, Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells were collected, and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. After initial childhood vaccination, peripheral blood from the infants was also collected at 4 and 9 months being similarly processed and stored. Ultimately, the cells were shipped here to Baltimore for flow cytometry analysis.\n\nUpon arrival in Baltimore, the cells are thawed and processed for Spectral Flow Cytometry. For my thesis project, I am interested in how the maternal viral and antiretroviral exposure affects HEU-infant‚Äôs 1) Innate-like T cells, and 2) conventional alpha beta T cells, both at baseline and upon activation.\nInnate-like T cells (ILTs), including Natural Killer T cells (NKTs), Mucosal-associated Invariant T cells (MAITs), and Vùõæ9Vùõø2 (Vùõø2) T cells, are activated by both microbial metabolites as well as by innate cytokines. Once activated, they mount TH1-like cytokine and cytotoxic responses, playing important roles against pathogens in adults. The effect exerted by in utero HIV exposure on infant ILTs is unknown.\n\n\n\n1. Eckard, A. R., Kirk, S. E. & Hagood, N. L. Contemporary Issues in Pregnancy (and Offspring) in the Current HIV Era.

    "text": "Rapid tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 earlier this week so have been out-of-comission lab-wise. Now that the fever has retreated and needing a break from dissertation writing, taking some time this evening to document some of the more-interesting rabbit-holes from the last couple months.\nFor context, my thesis lab first switched to using the spectral flow cytometry back in 2020 when a 6-month backlog of clinical COVID specimens monopolized the mass cytometers on campus disrupting the original plans for specimen processing. Looking back, those first few months were wild, as we attempted to treat the experiments like simply larger conventional experiments (by taking three hours to manually compensate each fcs file‚Ä¶ shudder). It wasn‚Äôt until after encountering Laura Johnston tutorial videos on the University of Chicago Flow‚Äôs Youtube channel in early 2021 that our unmixing control practices changed and the data resolution (and reproducibiltiy) improved dramatically.\nIn terms of my descent into spectral flow cytometry madness, my first independent experiment on the 4L Cytek Aurora was in August 2021. It was probably in early 2022 when I first encountered this 2013 paper from David Novo, Gerald Gregori and Bartek Rajwa. In it, they both simulated data and used data from an early spectral flow cytometer to compare different methods of unmixing.\nOne of the figures that always stood out to me was Figure 2:\n\nI was fascinated by the differences in spreading for the different unmixing methods and was curious to test on my own samples. Unfortunately, that was beyond my ability at the time. I read curiously at the methods description, having only recently managed to get a PCA plot and MANOVA to output correctly in R.\nIt wasn‚Äôt until early 2023 that I encountered Christopher Hall‚Äôs flowUnmix package that attempted to provide some unmixing options for the mentioned unmixing methods. I managed to get every one to work for my samples, but the non-negative least squares (NNLS) failed for all but the most downsampled .fcs file due to being so slow to run.\nFast forward a couple years (and a lot more coding in R) I circled back to this problem. The nnls function comes from the nnls R package, taking two arguments, 1) a matrix of unmixing control signatures, and the raw sample values iterated over in a row-fashion.\nLike everyone else on Twitter these last two years on the Bioinformatics side, we all know someone who has been proselytizing the gospel of Rust (Josiah Parry and Rob Patro in the case of my feed). Similar to how the RCPP and cpp11 R packages can be used to connect C++ functions within an R package, extendr does something similar for Rust.\nSo I decided this would be a good target example.\nAfter some effort, it worked!\nWhen I run OLS, the test-data completes in around 0.015 seconds (there‚Äôs a reason it is used for live unmixing). By comparison, the nnls package‚Äôs nnls (running Fortran77 in the background) takes 0.144 seconds (approximate 9x as long). My first attempt in Rust using the nnls crate took 0.075, so some improvement. However, I was still iterating in R and passing individual vectors to rust. Would it be faster if I iterated over the sample matrix within Rust? I proceeded to modify, and sure enough, completes at 0.047 seconds.\nSo in the end, I managed to get nnls from taking 9x as long as OLS to 3x with an initial attempt with only introductory rust knowledge. Not bad for now, but room to improve going forward.\nHowever, looking at it, I realized my mental image of NNLS from the Novo et al.¬†2013 paper was inverted, I had actually been thinking of the WLS/Poisson-regression unmixing approaches. Implementing those approaches into my code-base will need to wait for another day (and hopefully not involve hand-coding my own Rust crate :D )."

Lyke2, Cristiana Cairo3\n1 Molecular Microbiology and Immunology Graduate Program, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA 2 Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA 3 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.\nSpectral flow cytometry (SFC), with its capacity to resolve similar fluorophores and ability to rapidly acquire large number of events, enables more comprehensive phenotypic and functional analyses than conventional flow cytometry. Unmixing controls (both single-color and unstained) are critical for proper unmixing of high-dimensional panels, as their fluorescence signatures provision the reference matrix. Discrepancies between the fluorescence signatures of unmixing controls and full-stained samples add uncertainty to the unmixing calculations and can lead to loss of resolution for individual fluorophores, (particularly in large panels with broader co-expression of markers) producing batch effects.\nThese batch effects can affect performance, increase complexity, and impact reproducibility of unsupervised analysis methods that rely on median fluorescent intensity (MFI) for clustering, dimensionality visualization and normalization. While previous efforts at quality control have focused on factors related to instruments and/or full-stained samples, few tools exist to evaluate unmixing controls despite their critical importance. At the same time, the criteria for delineating a good unmixing control and re-using previous controls without affecting the unmixing remain loosely defined.\nWe therefore set out to quantitatively assess how variation in the fluorescence signature and/or brightness of controls impacts unmixing of full-stained samples. To this end, we have been working on an R package called Luciernaga, which includes a collection of tools for quality control and fluorescence signature profiling of unmixing controls. Leveraging its ability to characterize normalized fluorescence signatures for individual cells, we grouped and quantified, in every unmixing control, cells with similar signatures across 20 experiments. In the process, we identified ‚Äúvariant‚Äù signatures indicative of tandem degradation and non-specific binding of decoupled fluorophores associated with specific unmixing issues. We then grouped cells with shared variant signatures in each unmixing control and used them to generate a .fcs file containing a single variant signature. Keeping all unmixing controls but one constant, we swapped in a variant signature at a time, performing iterative unmixing in R with ordinary least squares. This process allowed us to characterize how variations in fluorescence signature, brightness, or both factors impact the unmixing of the full-stained sample. Our work builds on fluorescence signature, brightness, or both factors impact the unmixing of the full-stained sample.\nOur work builds on the existing guidelines for good unmixing controls, while providing mechanistic explanations for each. We also highlight advantages of profiling control signatures before performing unmixing as a means to mitigate unmixing issues."

    "text": "So where are you from?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up as a Third Culture Kid, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù is a question I always hated. The simple concise answers that the majority of my peers would provide when introductions were being made inevitably detoured down a rabbit-hole when it was my turn to introduce myself.\nMy family, originally from southwest Michigan, USA moved to Chiapas, Mexico for work when I was two. I learned to read and write in Spanish long before I did in English; my childhood memories include birding around the local Mayan ruins on the weekends; and the only time in my life I had ever been to Cancun was after a grueling 22 hour bus ride through the mountains so that I could take my SAT exam for the US university admissions process, as it was the closest testing site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI moved back to the US for university when I was 17. I graduated from Northwest College, receiving my A.S in Natural Resources Biology. It was during my time in Powell, Wyoming that thanks to undergraduate research opportunities through INBRE that I first became interested in Microbiology. After Northwest, I transferred to the University of Wyoming where I received a B.S. in Molecular Biology and Microbiology, and got my first taste of immunology researching Natural Killer cell responses in mice to secondary Toxoplasma gondii infection in the lab of Dr.Jason Gigley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n After university, I served in the Peace Corps as a Secondary Science Teacher in Ghana from 2016-2018. I taught biology and chemistry at a rural high school in the Volta Region. During my time in Ghana, I worked on secondary projects focused on Malaria that led to my decision to enter a Microbiology and Immunology PhD program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I moved to Baltimore for my PhD in 2018. After a year and a half of classes and passing my qualifying exam, I was excited to finally start full time in the lab. Since that was March 2020, that was not going to happen. While stuck at home, I volunteered for the Pfizer Phase I clinical trial taking place at the University of Maryland Center for Vaccine Development and somehow ended up having family and friends telling me they saw my arm in the newspaper for the next nine months.\n\n\n\n\n My PhD research was focused on understanding the impact that exposure to maternal HIV infection and antiretrovirals before birth had on immune systems of HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants. Our main cell types of interest were Innate-like T cells (gamma-delta T cells, MAIT, and NKTs) and adaptive T cell subsets (specifically antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells). While we started off working with conventional flow cytometry while planning on doing mass cytometry, we transitioned to spectral flow cytometry (SFC) during the pandemic due to availability. As early adopters of the technology at our local institution, through trial-and-error we re-discovered that you can‚Äôt treat spectral flow cytometry like a conventional flow cytometry and just throw compensation at it to fix the problem. From these early mistakes and encountering best practices shared by the University of Chicago (thanks Laura!) we quickly progressed to getting good unmixing and building larger panels.Around this time I became interested in unsupervised analysis. I ended up teaching myself R in the course of the year, but encountered issues where existing R packages wouldn‚Äôt scale to our SFC dataset size when we were acquiring 3 million cells per sample to get decent ILT numbers from cord blood. After discovering Bioconductor, I started working on two R packages (Luciernaga and Coereba) to address some of these areas.And that‚Äôs journey here. The current questions that wake me up at 2 AM are figuring out how to work with uncertainty in unmixing to get better resolution and consistency in SFC experiments, and more robust ways to analyse and draw meaning from the results where we are not just unaware of what is happening in the other 99% of the collected sample."

    "text": "After seeing Florian Mair‚Äôs talk at MetroFlow last month, I was curious how increasingly complex unmixing matrices would affect the staining index of my individual single color controls. This spawned an early-morning spectral flow cytometry meets coding rabbit-hole. Seeing as I have shared also on this on Bluesky, I have decided this a good-enough topic to expand in my reattempt at blogging random rabbit holes and topics that I find fascinating.\nHaving access to fluorophore reference signatures as part of my Luciernaga R package, I started working on some code that when given a certain number of fluorophores, it would randomly select that many non-identical fluorophores from the available reference signatures. These would be added to the unmixing matrix, and then the single-color unstained control would be unmixed with that matrix. Finally, a stain index measurement would be calculated from the unmixed single-color control to measure separation of the positive from the negative. Then this process would be repeated 20 times with different combination of reference signatures. I then iterated the data-generation process from 2 to 55 fluorophores in the unmixing matrix, getting these pretty results üòç\n For the case above, this was was for a BUV805 CD4 single-color control. It has a good staining index in our panel, so it was fascinating watching the switch from great to OK becoming complete once it approached 40-colors.\nMeanwhile, fluorophore BV786 (CCR6 as antigen in this case) was a slow descent into madness.\n\nAnd Fluorophore BUV563 (CD69 as antigen in this case) somewhere in between.\n\nMy preliminary exploration past this point suggested the switch from high plateau to descent/low plateau coincides with the decline in total percentage contribution for the individual fluorophores peak detector relative to the contributions from the other fluorophores. For the BUV805 example, it maintained the high-ground when above 30% total signal for that detector, but dropped to low plateau when it‚Äôs overall contribution was decreased to ~20%.\nBut this was an early morning rabbit-hole, not a deep-dive, so validating this initial observation will have to wait for another day."
