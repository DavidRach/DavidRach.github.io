    "text": "Hi, I am David. Who am I?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen meeting someone, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù is the question that growing up as a Third Culture Kid I dreaded, as the simple concise answer most people expected quickly detoured down a rabbit-hole.\nMy family, originally from southwest Michigan, moved to Chiapas, Mexico for work when I was two. I learned to read and write in Spanish long before I did in English; my childhood memories include birding around the local Mayan ruins on the weekends; and the only time I have ever been to Cancun was after enduring a 22 hour bus ride through the mountains so that I could take my SAT exam for the US university admissions process, as it was the closest testing site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI moved back to the US for university when I was 17. I graduated from Northwest College, receiving my A.S in Natural Resources Biology. It was during my time in Powell, Wyoming that thanks to undergraduate research opportunities through INBRE that I first became interested in Microbiology. After Northwest, I transferred to the University of Wyoming where I received a B.S. in Molecular Biology and Microbiology, and got my first taste of immunology researching Natural Killer cell responses in mice to secondary Toxoplasma gondii infection in the lab of Dr.Jason Gigley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n After university, I served in the Peace Corps as a Secondary Science Teacher in Ghana from 2016-2018. I taught biology and chemistry at a rural high school in the Volta Region. During my time in Ghana, I worked on secondary projects focused on Malaria that led to my decision to enter a Microbiology and Immunology PhD program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I moved to Baltimore for my PhD in 2018. After a year and a half of classes and passing my qualifying exam, I was excited to finally start full time in the lab. Since that was March 2020, that was not going to happen. While stuck at home, I volunteered for the Pfizer Phase I clinical trial taking place at the University of Maryland Center for Vaccine Development and somehow ended up having family and friends telling me they saw my arm in the newspaper for the next nine months."

Cristiana Cairo and Kirsten Lyke.\nMy thesis research seeks to understand the impact that prenatal exposure to maternal viral load and antiretrovirals has on Innate-like and Adaptive T cells of HIV-exposed Uninfected Infants during early life. Working with a Malawian clinical cohort, I process cryopreserved cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for Spectral Flow Cytometry.\nWhen not in lab or thinking about autofluorescence, I enjoy birding, trail running, kayaking, coffee, learning new languages and have occasionally had a plant survive my summer gardening attempts."

    "text": "HEU Infants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn estimated 1.5 million HIV+ women give birth per year. Thanks to improved antiretrovirals (and critically, affordable access to them in the most affected countries), vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child is increasingly prevented. These HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants are a growing patient population in many countries.1\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being born uninfected, during their first six months of life, HEU infants have increased morbidity for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections compared to HIV-unexposed (HU) Infants living in the same communities2. It‚Äôs hypothesized that inflammation at the fetal-maternal interface driven by exposure to maternal virus (and viral proteins) may perturb the developing infant immune system, resulting in the observed increased morbidity in early life.3,4 Confoundingly, antiretrovirals (ART) can also drive inflammation at the fetal-maternal interface, and are reported to alter mitochondrial function5.\n\nTo better understand the contribution of maternal viremia to infant immune perturbation, we are analyzing a clinical cohort of Malawian infants with well-characterized prenatal HIV-exposure. Specifically, we are comparing three groups of infants born to women with: A) ART-treated HIV infection and undetectable viral load since before conception and through pregnancy (HEU-lo); B) HIV infection diagnosed and treated at mid-gestation or later, with high viral load (&gt;10,000 copies/mL) at enrollment (HEU-hi); and C) no HIV infection (HU).\nAt birth, Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells were collected, and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. After initial childhood vaccination, peripheral blood from the infants was also collected at 4 and 9 months being similarly processed and stored. Ultimately, the cells were shipped here to Baltimore for flow cytometry analysis.\n\nUpon arrival in Baltimore, the cells are thawed and processed for Spectral Flow Cytometry. For my thesis project, I am interested in how the maternal viral and antiretroviral exposure affects HEU-infant‚Äôs 1) Innate-like T cells, and 2) conventional alpha beta T cells, both at baseline and upon activation.\nInnate-like T cells (ILTs), including Natural Killer T cells (NKTs), Mucosal-associated Invariant T cells (MAITs), and Vùõæ9Vùõø2 (Vùõø2) T cells, are activated by both microbial metabolites as well as by innate cytokines. Once activated, they mount TH1-like cytokine and cytotoxic responses, playing important roles against pathogens in adults. The effect exerted by in utero HIV exposure on infant ILTs is unknown.\n\n\n\n1. Eckard, A. R., Kirk, S. E. & Hagood, N. L. Contemporary Issues in Pregnancy (and Offspring) in the Current HIV Era.
